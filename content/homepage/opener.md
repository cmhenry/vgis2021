#### Vanderbilt Graduate Ideas Symposium (2021)

The first annual Vanderbilt Graduate Ideas Symposium (VGIS, pronounced "veggies") will be held on *December 3rd, 2021.* All conference panels will take place in the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in the Political Science Department at Vanderbilt University. Organized and run by graduate students, VGIS is a space for Vanderbilt grad students at any stage to present ongoing work and get feedback from their peers in a conference-like environment without expending the resources for registration, travel, and accomodation.

Panels will be organized around two or three presenters, with an assigned discussant for each. Presenters will have fifteen minutes to present their research, three minutes for discussant response, and any remaining time for audience Q&A. Given space constraints in the CSDI space, Vanderbilt's health policies, and the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, all participants will be required to wear a mask.
