_Constructions of Power: Political Theory of Atlantic Architectures_

Presenter: [Katerina Traut](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/katerina-traut)

Discussant: [Colin Henry](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/colin-henry)

Abstract:
>I plan to present my theoretical argument for doing architectural history in political theory, and specifically the potential contributions of using architectural history/archaeological methods to political theory on race and empire. I will then outline my methodology and offer initial findings from my archival, ethnographic, and qualitative fieldwork in England and Ghana on national, imperial, and slave-trading forts and castles.

_Local Responses to High Migration: Exploring the Effects of the Venezuelan Migrant Crisis_

Presenter: [Alexander Tripp](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/alexander-tripp)

Discussant: [Colin Henry](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/jennifer-barnes)

Abstract:
>What are the factors that shape local governments’ responses to a surge in migrant inflows? I build and test a theoretical framework that predicts Colombian municipal responses to migration using a difference-in-difference approach.

_Political Economy of Forced Migration_

Presenter: [Dylan Irons](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/dylan-irons)

Discussant: [Nicholas Bednar](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/nicholas-bednar)

Abstract:
>I explore how the violations of socioeconomic rights lead to anxieties of poverty and trigger forced migration, contradicting current conclusions in the literature.

#### Panel 2 (10AM - 11AM): American Political Behavior {#panel2}

_Understanding the Political Meaning of Patriarchal Events_ *CW: Sexual assault*

Presenter: [Lauren Chojnacki](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/lauren-chojnacki)

Discussant: [Alex Lawhorne](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/alex-lawhorne)

Abstract:
>The project examines if, when, and how survivors of sexual assault assign political meaning to their experiences.

_The Consequences of Generational Identities_

Presenter: [Alexander Lawhorne](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/alex-lawhorne)

Discussant: [Mary Catherine Sullivan](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/mary-catherine-sullivan)

Abstract:
>This presentation will be about the effects or consequences of generational political identities, which are the focus of my dissertation work. I will discuss what we should expect from Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials or Gen Z members who identify strongly with their generation. Next I will present findings regarding the group norms, shared interests, common experiences, and intergroup conflict between generations. I am particularly hoping to receive suggestions about the potential implications of these trends for American politics, and advice for focusing the scope of this part of the project.


_Political Implications of Perceptions and Experiences of Identity-Based Discrimination_

Presenter: [Colette Marcellin](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/colette-marcellin)

Discussant: [Lauren Chojnacki](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/lauren-chojnacki)

Abstract:
>This (very preliminary) research explores the political implications of how individuals make sense of (1) their own experiences of identity-based discrimination and (2) their perceptions of the extent to which members of their identity group overall experience discrimination, using ANES data on reports of discrimination, voting behavior, and other forms of political engagement.

#### Panel 3 (11AM - 12PM): Comparative Institutions {#panel3}

_Rules-Induced Electoral Coalitions in Mixed Member Majoritarian (MMM) Systems_

Presenter: [Martin Gou](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/martin-gou)

Discussant: [Alexander Tripp](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/alexander-tripp)

Abstract:
>What determines candidate assignment to coalitions in mixed member majoritarian (MMM) systems? Is candidate assignment explained by relative party strength at the district level, or do electoral rules induce strategic behavior in candidate assignment? We provide evidence that local geographic support by a party in previous elections is not predictive of nominal candidacy assignment for the case of the 2021 federal election in Mexico, within the dominant party-brokered coalition. We leverage a ballot design that allows to partial out party-specific preferences within a coalition and take advantage of a coalition switch from a medium-sized party (the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico, PVEM). We then provide qualitative evidence that a constitutional cap on over-representation led the coalition broker (Morena) to assign more single-member candidacies to PVEM in anticipation of losing PR seats (usually reserved for party leadership) in the assignment process. 

_Presentations of Self, Representation, and Electoral Considerations_

Presenter: [Mary Catherine Sullivan](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/mary-catherine-sullivan)

Discussant: [Nicholas Bednar](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/nicholas-bednar)

Abstract:
>It is widely thought that how candidates present themselves to their district depends not only on candidates’ personality and home style, but also on their electoral environment. This paper uses over 5 million tweets to characterize how members of Congress present themselves to their district and assess how presentations vary within members in response to their electoral environments.

_Disaster Politics_

Presenter: [Preeti Nambiar](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/preeti-nambiar)

Discussant: [Chris Piper](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/chris-piper)

Abstract:
>Impact of disasters on bureaucratic capacity of a region - I believe disasters positively impact bureaucratic capacity. I plan to study disaster impact in electoral democracy context in a developing country: India.
